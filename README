Very basic helper abbreviations for writing xslt stylesheets. Like vivek Venugopalan's dbhelper.vim, uses the format ",<abbrev>", as in:
,tm ==> <xsl:template match=""></xsl:template>
,at ==> <xsl:apply-templates/>

It helps me a ton, hope it helps you too. Please send feedback to andrews AT oreilly.com.

Cheers.
